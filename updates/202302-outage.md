# Feb 2023, Outage

This is the maintainer of Xstl encrypted DNS.
Sorry for the inconvenience due to service outage about 4 minutes occured at KST 5:48.

## Reason

Our team noticed the potential service outage via LVM driver error while maintaining containers in the server, but we couldn't avoid the downtime as the error was from the hardware unfortunately.

## Schedules and changes

We restarted all nodes while reconnecting the storage device to rescue and it's all fine now.
All works has been made immediately to reduce downtime as possible.
