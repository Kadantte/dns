# Jul 2023, Outage

This is the maintainer of Xstl encrypted DNS.
Sorry for the inconvenience due to service outage about a day occured at KST Jul 14.

## Reason

Our team noticed the number of LVM driver errors and they occured the number of IO errors.
After the confirmation, we started investigation to know how many reconstruction would be required and confirmed that the reinstallation of service node is unavoidable.

6TB of data blocks were lost in the storage and it caused problem in LVM volumn.

## Schedules and changes

We tried to migrate right after the factor relation check as all critical data were known to be migratable.
Migration has been done from Jul 14 dinner time to Jul 15 morning by moving stored live snapshot data and reinitialization of new service.

All works has been made immediately to reduce downtime as possible.
